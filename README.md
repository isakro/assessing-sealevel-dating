    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.pdf`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj`
file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - open and run
`analysis/script/00dtm_prep.R` to compile the necessary raster data. -
finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the
`paper.pdf`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in
the R console
